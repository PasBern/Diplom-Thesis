This paper analyses a problem, which exist not only in Lithuania but also in most Central and East European countries. Energy intensity is at such high level that it causes financial difficulties nearly in all branches of energy. Resilient interaction between energy sector and economics define the fact that disproportions between energy sector and economics hinder the development of economics. Analysis focusing on proportions between various energy sectors and economies was carried out. These proportions expressed in a set of well-known energy-economic indexes in comparison with similar proportions of other countries revealed the primary reasons of the financial difficulties in energy sector, as well its macroeconomic impact. Concept of state energy conservation policy is presented which can evaluate links between energy and economics according to its proportions. Conditions for successful mastering of renewable energy resources are analysed and state operation mechanism is proposed."
