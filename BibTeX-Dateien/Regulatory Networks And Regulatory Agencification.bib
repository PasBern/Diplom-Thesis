  abstract = { The European regulatory space has been expanding rapidly since the
	1990s. The double movement towards a single market on the one hand
	and a Single European Regulatory Space on the other is evident almost
	everywhere. A new regulatory architecture is emerging and is expressed
	in the extension of regulatory capacities beyond the European Commission
	via two major forms of institutionalization: agencies and networks.
	This paper explores the politics and architecture of the institutionalization
	and administrative rationalization of the EU regulatory space and
	demonstrates (a) how agencies replace networks in a process that
	might best be called ‘agencification’; (b) how agencies compete
	with networks and are often able to create, employ, and control them,
	creating what might best be called ‘agencified networks’; and
	(c) how networking empowers agencies creating a new type of regulatory
	organization that might best be called a ‘networked agency’.
