This article analyses energy efficiency development in Lithuania since 1990 and the main legal, fiscal and financial and institutional measures implemented in Lithuania aiming to promote energy efficiency improvements. Energy intensity currently in Lithuania is almost 1.2 times higher than in EU-15 average but the trends are positive and energy intensity has declined by 2.25 times during the investigated period. The paper presents final and primary energy intensity trends in Lithuania and concludes that measures implemented in Lithuania had positive impact on energy efficiency improvements. The main driving forces for energy efficiency improvements in Lithuania were energy prices increase with regained independence form Russia and EU approximation."
