abstract = "
Energy security has again become an important public issue amid concerns about high energy prices and the occurrence of regional supply shortfalls. An assessment of the current state of oil security indicates that the risks of supply disruption have not diminished. The oil market outlook for the next two decades suggests an even greater need for oil security protection. With growing significance of global gas demand and trade, gas security is also becoming increasingly important.
In conclusion, although no global energy crisis appears to be on the horizon, some serious security concerns do exist and will likely intensify in the future. This means that there is no room for complacency on energy security. The existing oil emergency measures need to be extended to cover the developing countries and other energy sources."
