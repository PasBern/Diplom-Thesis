	In The Allocation Of Network Resources Through Entry/Exit Schemes},

  abstract = {The current definition of “commercial” gas networks in the European
	Union (EU) is based on entry/exit schemes and balancing mechanisms.
	This regulation of grid services aims to enhance the liquidity of
	wholesale markets. In order to facilitate the gas commodity trade
	among players with different network usage profiles and different
	network connection points, some network services are socialized across
	the market zone. That socialization of network services in the EU
	leaves the task to reconcile physical gas flows and commercial gas
	flows to a regulated system operator. We show that in practice, it
	leads, on the one hand, to offer less “commercial” transmission
	capacity than the physical capacity of the network, and on the other,
	to the cross-subsidization of line-pack services between high profile
	and low profile users. The guidelines proposed by the Agency for
	the Cooperation of Energy Regulators (ACER) for the gas balancing
	network code do not explicitly address all the drawbacks of existing
	entry/exit schemes, but they leave room to design mechanisms that
	increase the efficiency of short-term network allocation. Contributing
	to this open debate, we point out that improved allocation comes
	with market mechanisms to allocate short-term network services, instead
	of relying solely on Transmission System Operators' management of
	network resources.},
