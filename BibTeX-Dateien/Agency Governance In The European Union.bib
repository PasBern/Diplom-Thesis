  abstract = { The literature on European Union (EU) agencies has proliferated rapidly
	since the first essay collection on EU agencies was published by
	the Journal of European Public Policy in 1997. This collection picks
	up three thematic threads contained in the initial collection and
	provides state-of-the-art treatises on these different themes. The
	first theme addresses the causes and dynamics of the creation and
	design of regulatory bodies in EU governance, focusing not only on
	EU agencies but also on alternatives to the agency format, such as
	regulatory networks. Second, once agencies are established the consequences
	and trajectories of governance with and by EU agencies will be explored.
	Third, the design of EU agencies as independent, non-majoritarian
	institutions poses pressing questions with a view to their legitimacy
	and accountability. },
