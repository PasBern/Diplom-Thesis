This article summarises some of the results from the application of the Energy Indicators for Sustainable Development (EISD) tool for analysing trends, setting energy policy goals and monitoring progress towards these goals for Baltic States. This experience illustrates the potential applicability of the EISD methodology for energy policy development in economies in transition, using Baltic States as an example. The paper presents a summary of the analysis of six priority areas defined by EU accession requirements for new Member States and provides recommendations for sustainable energy policy development in Baltic States using this indicator approach."
