  abstract = {The underlying problem for governments in approaching security of
	supply in the new competitive markets is that they need to be seen
	to be â€œcomplacentâ€ about security of supply so that private investment
	to assure adequate security will be forthcoming. The alternativeâ€”governments
	promising to intervene when security is threatenedâ€”risks choking
	off the private investment that competitive markets might otherwise
	provide.},
