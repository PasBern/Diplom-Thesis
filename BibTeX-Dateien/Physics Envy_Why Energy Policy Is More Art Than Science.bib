abstract ={Relying on restrictive definitions of energy security in an attempt to delineate security indicators is unnecessary to expedient policy analysis and may actually impede prudent decision making. Three cases studies are examined as evidence that a heuristic model of energy security that relies on experiential knowledge specific to the nation provides a more practical way to conceptualize energy security and results in more prudent security policy.},
